## ☀️ Sergey Svistunov
> C# developer 

👔   I've worked in IT presales for many years. I started as a sysadmin and VBA developer, worked as a project manager, business analyst, and continued in presales. I've been researching, building and selling complex solutions all my life.
Then I decided to switch to programming and now I work as a C# developer.
<br>
***
### I have significant experience in three areas:
* Printing and document processing (Xerox and Kyocera),
* IoT projects for cars (Brightbox, C-Cars),
* Banking and payment systems (Ingenico, Blockchain startup).

💻 After years of working in so many very different companies and environments, around 2020 I decided to expand my skills in a more technical direction. I started with CodeWars achieving 3kyu level in C++ and Kotlin, then I applied that knowledge to real-world projects, some of which you can find here on GitHub.

> The world of programming isn't uncharted territory for me,  but it's still hard to learn to code well. 

### Over the years, my language path has looked like this:

#### :arrow_forward: QuickBasic ➔ 8086_assembly ➔ VBA ➔ VB6 ➔ VB.NET ➔ a looong break ➔ JavaScript ➔ C++ ➔ Kotlin ➔ Java ➔ C# 

<br>

I ended up getting a **C#** job, which means that I prioritize the .NET platform überall. Other languages and platforms will wait. <br>

### Languages I like: &nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="small_c-sharp-dot-net.png" height=57px> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="small_kotlin.png" height=57px>

🏃 Beside programming languages, I'm proficient in English, German and Russian. 
I used to do a lot of long-distance running, but now I mostly walk because of time constraints.
