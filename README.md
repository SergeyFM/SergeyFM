> C# .NET Software developer 

üëî   Hi! I'm a .NET developer with >10 years of IT experience.
I started as a sysadmin and VBA developer, worked as a project manager, business analyst, and for the longest time as an IT solutions engineer in pre-sales. I've been researching, building and selling complex solutions my whole life.

> Having worked in a variety of industries, I've gained not only technical, but also practical team player skills.
### I have experience in the following areas:
* Printing and document workflow&processing (Xerox and Kyocera) - 6 yrs,
* IoT projects for cars (Brightbox, C-Cars) - 2 yrs,
* Banking and payment systems (Ingenico, Blockchain startup) - 1 yr,
* Gas measurement equipment (Mirax-safety) - 8 mos.,
* Pharmaceutical industry (STADA) - currently.

üíª After years of working in technical pre-sales roles that required not only deep technical knowledge, but also people skills, I turned to software development exclusively. I started with CodeWars improving my proficiency in C++, Kotlin and later C# achieving 2kyu level, then I applied my skills in real-world projects, some of which you can find here on GitHub.

> The world of programming isn't uncharted territory for me,  but it's still hard to learn to code well. 

### Over the years, my language path has looked like this:

:arrow_forward: QuickBasic ‚ûî VBA ‚ûî VB6 ‚ûî VB.NET ‚ûî a looong break ‚ûî JavaScript ‚ûî C++ ‚ûî Kotlin ‚ûî C# 
<br> <br>
I ended up getting a **C#** job, and I prioritize the .NET platform √ºberall. Other languages and platforms are on the back burner. <br>

### Languages I like nowdays: &nbsp; <img src="small_c-sharp-dot-net.png" height=57px> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="FSharp.png" height=64px>

üèÉ Beside programming languages, I'm proficient in English, German and Russian. 
As a hobby, I used to do a lot of long-distance running, but now I mostly walk because of time constraints. I like photography (mostly street) and spending time with my family.
