> C# developer 

üëî   I've worked in IT presales for many years. I started as a sysadmin and VBA developer, worked as a project manager, business analyst, and for the longest time in presales. I've been researching, building and selling complex solutions all my life.
Then I decided to switch to programming and have been working as a C# developer for some time.

> Years in different industries make me a pretty unique kind of developer, combining a range of technical and business life skills.
### I have significant experience in ~three~four areas:
* Printing and document workflow&processing (Xerox and Kyocera) - 6 yrs,
* IoT projects for cars (Brightbox, C-Cars) - 2 yrs,
* Banking and payment systems (Ingenico, Blockchain startup) - 1 yr,
* Gas measurement equipment (Mirax-safety) - since 2023 and counting.

üíª After years of working in pre-sales, around 2020 I made a 90¬∞ turn towards system development and programming. I started with CodeWars achieving 3kyu level in C++ and Kotlin, then I applied that knowledge to real-world projects, some of which you can find here on GitHub.

> The world of programming isn't uncharted territory for me,  but it's still hard to learn to code well. 

### Over the years, my language path has looked like this:

#### :arrow_forward: QuickBasic ‚ûî 8086_assembly ‚ûî VBA ‚ûî VB6 ‚ûî VB.NET ‚ûî a looong break ‚ûî JavaScript ‚ûî C++ ‚ûî Kotlin ‚ûî Java ‚ûî C# 

<br>

I ended up getting a **C#** job, which means that I prioritize the .NET platform √ºberall. Other languages and platforms are on hold. <br>

### Languages I like: &nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="small_c-sharp-dot-net.png" height=57px> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="small_kotlin.png" height=57px>

üèÉ Beside programming languages, I'm proficient in English, German and Russian. 
I used to do a lot of long-distance running, but now I mostly walk because of time constraints.
