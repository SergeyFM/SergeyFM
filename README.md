## ☀️ Hi! I'm Sergey Svistunov. 

👔 I’m an experienced IT Presales engineer. Started as a Sysadmin, then worked as a Project manager, Business Analyst, and continued as a Presale - POS terminals, payment software and related services. I've been researching, building and selling IT solutions my whole life!
<br>
<br>
💻 After years of working in many very different companies and environments, around 2020 I decided to slide in more technical direction, I decided to become a professional software developer. I started with CodeWars achieving 3kyu level in **C++** and **Kotlin**: <img src="https://www.codewars.com/users/SergeyFM/badges/large?theme=light"> <br> And now I'm applying this knowledge to the projects you'll find here on GitHub.
<br><br>
The world of programming isn't uncharted territory for me because I’ve been in and out of coding since my student days. Learning to code is hard, so I don’t get discouraged when I make mistakes at first. I’m diligently acquiring the Kotlin programming language with a focus on Android and backend development. <br>
## I write code every day!

<br> <br>
💥 I’m very excited about turning my hobby into a job. My only regret is that I didn’t do it sooner! <br>
I’m happy to be part of the #GitHub community and have the chance to share my ideas and learn from you all! <br> <br>

🏃 Besides programming, my hobbies include marathon running, photography and learning human languages - so far I can speak English, German and my native language Russian.

Please feel free to let me know if anything. <br>
