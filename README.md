### ☀️ Hi there! My name is Sergey Svistunov.

👔 I’m an experienced Presales engineer. Started as a Sysadmin, then worked as a PM, BA, and continued as a Presales - POS payment terminals, software and related services. <br> <br>
💻 All things aside, in around 2020 I decided to become a professional software developer. I started with CodeWars achieving 3ku in C++ and Kotlin: <img src="https://www.codewars.com/users/SergeyFM/badges/large?theme=light" height=24px> <br>
The world of programming isn't an uncharted territory for me because I’ve been in and out of coding since my student days. Learning to program is hard, so I don’t get discouraged when I'm making a lot of mistakes at first. I’m acquiring Kotlin programming language with a focus on Android and backend development. <br>
<br>
💥 I’m very excited about turning my hobby into a job. My only regret is that I didn’t do it sooner! <br>
I’m happy to be part of the #GitHub community and have the chance to share my ideas and learn from you all. <br> <br>
🏃 Besides programming, my hobbies include marathon running, photography and learning of human languages - so far I can speak English, German and my native language Russian.

Please feel free to let me know if anything.
