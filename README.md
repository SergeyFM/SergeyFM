> C# .NET Software developer 

üëî   As a .NET developer with more than a decade of experience in the IT industry, my career began in roles such as a sysadmin and VBA developer. I then progressed to positions including project manager and business analyst, eventually focusing on pre-sales as an IT solutions engineer. Throughout my career, I have been dedicated to the research, development, and commercialization of complex IT solutions.

> My experience across diverse industries has endowed me with not only technical expertise but also valuable collaborative skills.
### I have experience in the following areas:
* Printing and document workflow&processing (Xerox and Kyocera) - 6 yrs,
* IoT projects for cars (Brightbox, C-Cars) - 2 yrs,
* Banking and payment systems (Ingenico, Blockchain startup) - 1 yr,
* Gas measurement equipment (Mirax-safety) - 8 mos.,
* Pharmaceutical industry (STADA) - currently.

üíª Following years in technical pre-sales roles, which enhanced both my technical acumen and interpersonal skills, I have exclusively focused on software development. I began my journey on CodeWars, working on my skills in C++, Kotlin, and later C#, achieving a 2kyu level. Subsequently, I leveraged these skills in real-world projects, some of which are showcased on my GitHub.

> The world of programming isn't uncharted territory for me,  but it's still hard to learn to code well. 

### My journey through programming languages:

:arrow_forward: QuickBasic ‚ûî VBA ‚ûî VB6 ‚ûî VB.NET ‚ûî a looong break ‚ûî languages I moved away from ‚ûî C# 
<br> <br>
Securing a position as a **C#** developer, I've placed a strong emphasis on the .NET platform, making it my primary area of focus. Consequently, other programming languages and platforms have been deprioritized. <br>

### Languages I like nowdays: &nbsp; <img src="small_c-sharp-dot-net.png" height=57px> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="FSharp.png" height=64px>

üèÉ Beyond programming languages, I am proficient in English, German, and Russian, and I have recently begun learning French.
Previously an avid long-distance runner, time constraints now see me primarily walking. My leisure interests include street photography and quality family time.
