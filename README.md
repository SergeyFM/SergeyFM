## ☀️ Hi! I'm Sergey Svistunov. 

👔 I've been working in IT Presales for many years. I started as a Sysadmin, then worked as a Project manager, Business Analyst, and continued in Presales - POS terminals, payment software and related services. I've been researching, building and selling complex solutions all my life!
<br>
<br>
💻 After years of working in so many very different companies and environments, around 2020 I decided to improve my skills in more technical areas. I've always wanted and actually did write programms. QuickBasic was my best friend at school. 
<br> I started with CodeWars achieving 3kyu level in **C++** and **Kotlin**: <img src="https://www.codewars.com/users/SergeyFM/badges/large?theme=light"> <br> And now I'm applying this knowledge to the projects you'll find here on GitHub.
<br><br>
There are several projects that I've done. Here are public ones on GitHub:
* Console application that imports word definition from LingQ portal
* Original solutions to typical coding riddles in Kotlin

The world of programming isn't uncharted territory for me, but still learning to code well is hard. I’m diligently acquiring the Kotlin programming language with a focus on Android and backend development. <br>
## I write code every day!
<sup> Something, anything, even if only a tiny edit to this document! <br>
(So far, I have not succeeded only once, on June 23, 2022. And it wasn't even the busiest day! :smirk:)</sup> <br>

💥 I’m happy to be part of the #GitHub community and have the chance to share my ideas and learn from you all! <br> <br>

🏃 Besides programming, my hobbies include marathon running, photography and learning human languages - so far I can speak English, German and my native language Russian.
