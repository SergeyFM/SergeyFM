> C# .NET Software developer 

üëî   As a .NET developer with more than a decade of experience in the IT industry, my career began in roles such as a sysadmin and VBA developer. I then progressed to positions including project manager and business analyst, eventually focusing on pre-sales as an IT solutions engineer. Throughout my career, I have been dedicated to the research, development, and commercialization of complex IT solutions.

> My experience across diverse industries has endowed me with not only technical expertise but also valuable collaborative skills.
### I have experience in the following areas:
* Printing and document workflow&processing (Xerox and Kyocera)
* IoT projects for cars (Brightbox, C-Cars)
* Banking and payment systems (Ingenico, Blockchain startup)
* Manufacturing - gas measurement equipment (Mirax-safety)
* Pharmaceutical industry (STADA)

üíª Following years in technical pre-sales roles, which enhanced both my technical acumen and interpersonal skills, I have exclusively focused on software development. I began my journey on CodeWars, working on my skills in C++, Kotlin, and later C#, achieving a 2kyu level. Subsequently, I leveraged these skills in real-world projects, most of which I can't showcase on my GitHub.

> The world of programming isn't uncharted territory for me,  but it's still hard to learn to code well. 

### My journey through programming languages:

üèÉ Beyond programming languages, I am proficient in English, German, and Russian, and I have recently begun learning French.
Previously an avid long-distance runner, time constraints now see me primarily walking. My leisure interests include street photography and quality family time.
