## ☀️ Hi! I'm Sergey Svistunov. 

👔   I've worked in IT presales for many years. I started as a sysadmin, then worked as a project manager, business analyst and continued in presales - POS terminals, payment software and related services. I've been researching, building and selling complex solutions all my life.
<br>

I have significant experience in three areas:
* Printing and document processing (worked at Xerox and Kyocera),
* IoT projects for cars (Brightbox, C-Cars),
* Banking and payment systems (Ingenico, Blockchain startup).

💻 After years of working in so many very different companies and environments, around 2020 I decided to expand my skills in a more technical direction. 
After all, I've always liked programming and QuickBasic was my best friend at school. 
<br> I started with CodeWars achieving 3kyu level in **C++** and **Kotlin**: <img src="https://www.codewars.com/users/SergeyFM/badges/large?theme=light"> <br> 
And then I applied this knowledge to the projects you can find here on GitHub.
<br>

There are several projects that I've done. Here are public ones on GitHub:
* Console application that imports word definition from LingQ portal
* Original solutions to typical coding riddles in Kotlin

The world of programming isn't uncharted territory for me,  but it's still hard to learn to code well. I'm diligently learning the Kotlin programming language with the focus on functional programming. I'm learning other languages and concepts as well. <br><br>
I've researched the current job market situation and decided I'd better (re)learn **Java**. <br>
* And now I'm working on a **C#** project and I'm back to **C++** as well. <br>

## I write code every day!

💥 I’m happy to be part of the #GitHub community and have the chance to learn and share my ideas! <br> <br>

🏃 Besides programming, my hobbies include marathon running, photography and learning human languages - so far I can speak English, German and Russian (my mother tongue).
